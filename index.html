    Hi so i am making a game for JEE/NEET students where they can compete with each other
    and hopefully get meaning to their stupid lives dedicated to a stupid exam which i was unable to crack and failed to get into IIT
    and now i hope to save others time and let them doze off the depression while learning new concepts of JEE/NEET 
    See you later when i am back till then listen to Kishore Kumar Nice singer
    bye losers(i am the biggest)
